In spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. Here are my projects from the class:

## Project 1: Personal Portfolio

My first project for this class was called Personal Portfolio. I was tasked with making a web page using R, RStudio, and Quarto.

In this project I:

-   Learned how to create a basic website

-   Render and push code to a github repo

-   Got familiar with RMarkdown

Here is the link to my website's homepage! [Click here to view homepage](index.html)

## Project 2: Minnesota tree growth

This project was all about manipulating and summarizing data with dplyr using a long term tree growth observation record from Minnesota.

## Project 3: Data Wrangling and Visualization — COVID-19

In this project I gained experience using COVID-19 data to practice data wrangling and visualization skills. In addition, I became more familiar with using flextable.

## Project 4: **Statistics in R**

This project helped me gain familiarity with calculating statistics in R. In this project I used several statistical tests such as chi-square, t-tests, and correlation tests. The data used for this project is from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, which is a collaborative effort involving more than 2000 scientists and students investigating ecological processes over long temporal and broad spatial scales.

## Project 5:

## Project 6: **Machine Learning in Hydrology**

For this project I used Tidymodels & CAMELS datasets to gain experience with modeling and building a workflow.

## Project 7: Personal Project Kickoff

This project served as a draft of the introduction, data, and methods sections for the scientific paper of my final research project for the class.

## Project 8: **Machine Learning — The Whole Game Plan**

![](images/final_plot.png)

In this project I applied my knowledge of the Machine Learning process to create a complete machine learning pipeline for a regression problem. To to this I build off of my work in project 6.

## Project 9: Personal **Project Updates**

This project included the draft of the results and discussion for the scientific paper of my final research project. Additionally, I expand on the methods section of the paper.
