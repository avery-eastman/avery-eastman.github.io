In spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R.

My first project for this class was called Personal Portfolio. I was tasked with making a web page using R, RStudio, and Quarto.

In this project I:

• Learned how to create a basic website

• Render and push code to a github repo

• Got familiar with RMarkdown

Here is the link to my website's homepage!
