Hey! I'm Avery, I am a third-year undergraduate at Colorado State University, majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I am keen to apply my knowledge of earth systems and sustainability science to real world applications. I hope to gain fieldwork and research experience to further my knowledge, skills and to build a professional network. Some of my interests include rock climbing, camping, and baking!
